668,CATHODE,cathode,"Cathode (styled as CATHODE) is an engine built by the Creative Assembly in partnership with AMD for the 2014 video game Alien: Isolation. It is a highly modified version of the engine created for an earlier title, Viking: Battle for Asgard. The trademark for Cathode's name was filed by SEGA on August 26th 2013, and eventually granted February 20th 2014.

The Cathode engine was named after its bespoke node-based scripting functionality which allowed for live edit flowgraphs to control game logic. This system ran inside of a toolkit created for Cathode named the Creative Assembly Game Editor (CAGE) in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) style. It allowed for the use of prefabs to quickly build upon existing scripts. The Cathode scripting system covered a range of systems including particles, lighting, props, AI scripts, audio, zoning, and character setup.

When the Cathode scripting system was implemented into the engine during production on Alien: Isolation, a large portion of already completed work had to be scrapped or re-worked from old 3DS Max scripts, causing around 6 months worth of production scripts to be lost.

The initial greenlight demo for Alien: Isolation was built with an early version of Cathode when work began to convert it from the Viking engine which featured just one shadow casting light source among other technical constraints. While early public demo and press builds of the game included a splashscreen for Cathode, references to it were removed in the final shipped game. The engine name was later added to store descriptions after its trademark approval in the EU, although the CAGE toolkit was never publicly released, despite being referenced heavily in the game's EULA.

Cathode was built to ship to PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC - however its primary title Alien: Isolation was later shipped to Nintendo Switch, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android by Feral Interactive. Cathode provides platform-specific optimisations through two core systems: being ""next-gen"" flags in flowgraph scripting, and 32-bit and 64-bit binary builds. Flowgraph flags were typically used for optimising functionality like depth of field, whereas binary builds were used for enabling and disabling core functionality such as dynamic lights and environmental effects (such as animated monitors in Alien: Isolation). Notably Alien: Isolation's PC build utilises the 32-bit binary optimisations, yet the ""next-gen"" flowgraph optimisations. This was an oversight that was later corrected in the Windows Store build released in 2020 by Lab42.",,308.0

By abstracting and providing a clear interface to some of the more complex back-end systems, development time and effort can be concentrated on the actual mechanics and logic of the environment being created.

Historically, Rapture has evolved from a few previous languages each providing some more functionality to the overall design, however, the main emphasis has always been on speed and stability.  To this end, many ‘features’ of modern programming and scripting languages are not present.  Rapture is not object-oriented nor is it (currently) runtime mutable and extensible through libraries and plugins.  Rapture is built for speed and stability.

Traditionally, Rapture has been used to create large scale multi-user games (MUDs) in which text is the primary interface.  However, the structure of Rapture is general enough to allow development of various different projects.  For instance, an interactive chat system was developed in conjunction with a United Nations affiliated organization.

1627,TrueMotion,truemotion,"TrueMotion is a audio/video compression format developed by the Duck Corporation. It was used by several video games as a medium-quality format for showing full motion video, particularly in Sega Saturn titles.

TrueMotion typically results in higher quality video than rival format Cinepak, the ""standard"" video format used in Saturn games of this era. It is, however, inferior to the MPEG compression utilised by the Video CD Card. The Sega Dreamcast has built-in MPEG support, rendering TrueMotion obsolete in the next generation of Sega console hardware.

TrueMotion was typically seen in games which full motion video played a relatively important role in the game; usually Japanese dating simulators or more novelty releases, or in introductory movies. In situations where video was less of a concern (or in earlier Saturn titles), Cinepak was seen as sufficient.",[55200],341.0

1638,Sega Triforce,sega-triforce,"The Triforce (トライフォース) is an arcade board developed in a joint venture between Sega, Nintendo, and Namco. It was also the result of a partnership between Sega and Namco that started a few months prior to the board's reveal. The Triforce is based on the Nintendo GameCube video game console to reduce development costs, and allowed for arcade ports of home console games, and vice versa. It is named after the magical, often sought-after object in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series.

While the platform was shared between the three companies, Nintendo was not in the business of producing arcade games at the time, so it licensed its properties to Sega and Namco. Sega was the first to launch a game for the system with Virtua Striker 2002 in the Autumn of 2002, which shipped on Sega's propietary GD-ROM format (with later releases doing the same). Namco would not release a game for the system until 2005, and would ship its software on ROM cartridges.

In 2012, a homebrew application was released for the Wii that enabled this GameCube-derived console to run Mario Kart Arcade GP and its sequel (see the list below). The coder stated that support for other games and additional features are possible but emphasised that he would not be releasing homebrew or information due to his anger at others in the homebrew scene who had leaked his work.[4].

Westwood first used W3D on Emperor: Battle for Dune and for their first-person shooter Command & Conquer: Renegade and their massively multiplayer online role-playing game Earth & Beyond.

After Westwood was dissolved by their parent company, Electronic Arts, the engine was renamed SAGE (Strategy Action Game Engine) and updated for the release of Command & Conquer: Generals. The rendering portion remained nearly identical to the W3D engine, but most other elements had been redesigned from the ground up. The updated SAGE engine allowed for dynamic lighting that would cast realistic shadows and reflections on most objects, as well as higher quality visual effects and a stop-motion camera feature. The SAGE engine would continue to be used by EA Los Angeles on additional titles in the Command & Conquer series and on the real-time strategy series The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth.

Following the release of the Command & Conquer 3 expansion Kane's Wrath, the engine underwent a large overhaul of its major systems. This new version of the engine was called SAGE 2.0 and was first used on Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3.
