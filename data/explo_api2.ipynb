Each character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, making character selection more than just choosing a skin. The character models themselves are of a more realistic style this time around, as opposed to the big-head anime style of the original Hot Shots Golf.\n\nThere are several different modes of play, from standards like stroke, match, and tournament, to the 'vs. mode', through which new characters can be unlocked. Gameplay itself is a version of the standard 'tap-tap-tap' variety used by the majority of golf games.",
